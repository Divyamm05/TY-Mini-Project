Overview
This repository contains our comprehensive investigation into credit card fraud detection methodologies, focusing on addressing the pervasive issue of class imbalance through the application of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). We systematically assessed and compared various SMOTE implementations, including Regular, Borderline, Safe-Level, and Hybrid variants, to understand their impact on critical performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Key Components
1. Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing script handles the cleaning, normalization, and preparation of the dataset. It ensures that the dataset is in an optimal format for model training and evaluation.

2. SMOTE Variants Implementation
We implemented and compared various SMOTE techniques to handle class imbalance:
Regular SMOTE: Synthesizes new instances between existing minority class instances.
Borderline SMOTE: Focuses on instances near the decision boundary.
Safe-Level SMOTE: Considers the safety level of generated samples to avoid noise.
Hybrid SMOTE: Combines multiple SMOTE strategies to leverage their strengths.

3. Model Training and Evaluation
The models were trained using various machine learning algorithms. We meticulously analyzed their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the efficacy of each SMOTE implementation.

4. Results Analysis
Our analysis provided nuanced insights into the impact of different SMOTE variants on the performance of fraud detection models. By mitigating class imbalance, these techniques enhanced the models' ability to discern fraudulent transactions amidst legitimate ones.

Conclusion
Our investigation underscores the critical importance of addressing class imbalance in credit card fraud detection systems. The judicious application of SMOTE techniques not only improved model robustness but also laid the groundwork for future advancements in fraud mitigation strategies.
